# Technologies

I mostly use Tailwind CSS for styling. It's easy and quick to use for nearly every website. For Vue.js, I also prefer to use SCSS. 
I'm still working on a own component library. Temporarly, I use Vuesax as Vue Component library and Chakra UI for React.

Here the Technologies, I mentioned:
