# Git Guidelines

In order for me and other contributors to understand how the code has changed, it is tremendously important to have clear commit messages and branch names.
For this reason, I want to stick to these guidelines as much as possible.


<Callout>
  For the naming, I always use camel case (e.g. my-branch-name). [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Camel_case)

## Commit Message

A commit message is composed of a title and its description (exception init).
Just like in this code example below:

`git commit -m "feature: an awesome feature"`

I mainly use the following titles:
- feature
- init
- fix
- hotfix
- style

Most of the titles should be relatively self-explanatory. 

## Branches Tooling

If you never worked with Git (in collaboration) before, note these following things:
- Never work directly on the `main` oder `develop` branch. Create a new branch with `git branch "<branch-name>"`
- When pushing to the develop branch, please at least select me [kaiseryao](https://github.com/kaiseryao) as the reviewer.
- Try to work only on the thing, you mentioned in the branch name. Try to avoid creating too "general" branch names.
- Thank you for every contribution!

For the branch titles, please use the following:
- feature
- fix
- release

and specify the feature/fix/release as clear as possible.

For example: `git branch "feature: navbar-animation"`
